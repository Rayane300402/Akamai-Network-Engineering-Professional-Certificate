# Capstone Project Overview

This capstone project is completed as part of the *Operating Systems Fundamentals* course in the Akamai Network Engineering Professional Certificate. The project simulates the setup of a new subsidiary company created to help Akamai expand into the Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) market.

In this scenario, Akamai has ordered a file server that will be used by the new company. The task is to configure the server, plan user access, organize the file system, apply appropriate permissions, and establish a backup solution. The final deliverable is presented either as a PowerPoint presentation or recorded demonstration.

This project includes:

- Choosing a company name for the new subsidiary.
- Creating user accounts for two employees and two interns.
- Designing and implementing a file system structure suited to the company’s needs.
- Applying permissions, groups, and any special attributes as required.
- Adding sample files to demonstrate usage.
- Creating a backup plan and documenting the backup commands.

The uploaded presentation shows the decisions made and the configuration implemented on the virtual machine. Screenshots or recorded demonstration highlight the user accounts, directory layout, permissions, and backup setup.
